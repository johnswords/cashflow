# Cashflow Balance Sheet Multiplayer ‚Äì Product Requirements v1.2 (Working)

## 0. Revision Snapshot (September 20, 2025)
- Load screen, game dashboard, player sheet workflow, audit modal, end-game flow, and audio toggle are implemented.
- Leaderboard exists (backend + basic view) but requires polish and richer UX.
- Timers, responsive 1080p layout, and expanded animations remain backlog items.

## 1. Background & Objective
- Extend the original single-player Cashflow worksheet into a persistent, multi-player experience with an unmistakable retro arcade feel.
- Retain Rich Dad Cashflow math while adding guardrails (diff confirmations, audit trail, corrections, winner ceremony) to make live game nights effortless.

## 2. Goals & Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Host creates a new game, configures 2‚Äì6 players, and lands on the shared dashboard in ‚â§ 2 minutes without manual data entry.
- ‚úÖ Every sheet change persists immediately to SQLite and can be resumed from the load screen without data loss.
- ‚úÖ Audit log captures field-level diffs, identifies corrections, and supports rewinding to prior state.
- üîÑ Leaderboard highlights top finishing cashflow scores with contextual detail (snapshot, comment, completion date) and easy navigation back to completed games.
- üéØ Experience runs comfortably on a shared 1080p display with SNES/GameCube-style audiovisual cues.

## 3. Non-Goals (v1)
- Enforcing strict turn order, multi-device sync, or online multiplayer.
- Complex financial modelling beyond the existing worksheet calculations.
- Game archival/deletion workflows (duplicate to restart if needed).
- Authentication/authorization or cloud sync.

## 4. Target Users & Scenarios
- **Primary:** Henry + family/friends running Cashflow nights on a single large screen.
- **Secondary:** Facilitators wanting to store multiple sessions and review prior adjustments.

## 5. Experience Requirements

### 5.1 Load Screen (Implemented)
- Actions: `New Game`, `List Games`, `Leaderboard`.
- Retro styling with keyboard navigation (arrow / enter / esc).
- Audio toggle persists preference across major screens.

### 5.2 New Game Setup (Implemented)
- Steps: title (optional), player count (2‚Äì6), per-player name + unique color (blue, purple, orange, red, green, yellow).
- Validation: names required/unique, colors unique, live error states.
- On confirm: creates `game_id`, clones default sheet state, auto-selects first player.

### 5.3 Games List (Implemented)
- Sorted by `updatedAt` desc with status badge (Active/Completed).
- Shows player roster, last played, quick actions: `Resume`, `Audit Log`, `End Game` (if active).
- Refresh control to re-fetch backend state.

### 5.4 Game Dashboard (Implemented)
- Player cards display: name, color, cash, salary, passive income, total income/expenses, cashflow, kid count.
- Recent changes panel (latest 3 audit entries per player) with human-friendly field labels.
- Actions: `Open Sheet`, `Audit Log` (modal), `End Game` (modal).
- Audio toggle in header.

### 5.5 Player Sheet View (Implemented)
- Reuses Rat Race & Fast Track layouts.
- Controls: `Back`, `Switch Sheet`, `Save & Return`, global audio toggle.
- Save confirmation modal lists field-level diffs, allows marking corrections (auto-checked when invoked from audit log).
- Saving emits audit entry, plays ‚Äúsave‚Äù chime, and resets baseline state.

### 5.6 Audit Log Modal (Implemented)
- Columns: timestamp, player, entry type (`turn` vs `correction`), field list.
- Filters by player; paginated fetch (50 entries with ‚ÄúLoad More‚Äù).
- ‚ÄúCorrect‚Äù shortcut preloads historical snapshot and opens sheet for editing (logs new correction entry).

### 5.7 End Game Flow (Implemented)
- Modal selects winner, preview of final stats (cash, passive income, totals, cashflow), optional comment.
- On confirm: auto-saves snapshot to leaderboard, updates game status, plays victory fanfare, closes modal.

### 5.8 Leaderboard View (MVP Complete ‚Äì Needs Polish)
- Shows ranked list (shared ranks for ties) filtered to completed games, sorted by cashflow desc + completion date.
- Winner comment shown inline; row click loads completed game read-only (future: open in recap view).
- Next iteration: styling refresh, filter controls (timeframe/player), completed-game read-only view.

## 6. Data & Persistence Model (SQLite)
| Entity | Fields |
| --- | --- |
| Game | `id`, `title`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `completed_at`, `winner_player_id`, `winner_comment` |
| Player | `id`, `game_id`, `name`, `color`, `sheet_state` (JSON), `last_modified_at` |
| AuditLogEntry | `id`, `game_id`, `player_id`, `timestamp`, `entry_type`, `field_paths[]`, `before_snapshot` (JSON), `after_snapshot` (JSON), `notes?`, `origin_entry_id?` |
| LeaderboardRecord | `id`, `game_id`, `player_id`, `cashflow_value`, `captured_at`, `winner_comment?` |

Implementation details:
- WAL enabled, foreign keys enforced.
- Kysely migrations under `src/backend/db/migrations`.
- Transactions required for sheet save (player update + audit entry + game timestamp).

## 7. Business Rules & Validation
- Derived values (net income, cashflow) are read-only; store computed totals in UI only.
- Player names and colors must be unique within a game.
- Audit entries require at least one `field_path`; corrections reference `origin_entry_id`.
- Games are immutable once completed; duplicate to restart.
- Audio preference defaults to enabled, stored in Vuex (future: persist per browser).

## 8. Technical Requirements
- Vue 2 + Vuex; new views live under `src/components/app/`.
- REST API served from `src/backend/server.js` using Koa, `@koa/router`, `koa-bodyparser`.
- Zod schemas for payload validation (`src/backend/validators`).
- Utility helpers:
  - `src/utils/diff.js` ‚Äì sheet diff builder for audit entries.
  - `src/utils/cashflow.js` ‚Äì financial summaries.
  - `src/utils/audio.js` ‚Äì Web Audio engine with SNES-style tones and mute toggle.
- Dev proxy in `vue.config.js` routes `/api` to `http://localhost:4000`.
- Data directory `data/` must exist (created automatically) and remain gitignored.

## 9. UX, Audio & Accessibility
- Retro palette, high-contrast gradients, `Press Start 2P` font.
- Keyboard navigation across major flows; buttons have visible focus states.
- Audio cues: save (two-tone blip, <0.2s), victory (4-note arpeggio, <1s). Global toggle present on load screen, dashboard, player sheet.
- Modals always include explicit primary/secondary actions; confirmation modals show diff summaries.
- Future: integrate subtle CRT overlay and optional chiptune loop on load screen (opt-in).

## 10. Telemetry & Logging (Future Consideration)
- Provide debug flag to console-log API requests/responses for live sessions.
- Export/backup feature (JSON or CSV) remains a backlog item.

## 11. Testing & Acceptance
- Manual regression (until automated tests exist):
  1. New game creation (2, 6 players) ‚Üí ensure color uniqueness errors.
  2. Sheet save diff detection, correction save from audit log.
  3. End game snapshot, verify leaderboard row, audio cues fire.
  4. Resume completed game via list ‚Üí game screen shows read-only state.
- Automated roadmap: Vue Test Utils for view flows, backend integration suite using sqlite in-memory.

## 12. Open Questions & Assumptions
- Leaderboard UX: Should completed games open in read-only sheet view or a dedicated recap screen?
- Recent change labeling: need friendly strings for nested investment fields (e.g., `investments.realEstate[0].income`).
- Audio persistence: store preference in localStorage? (Current session-only)
- Winner comment length limit (default 280 chars). Confirm acceptable.

## 13. Backlog & Enhancements
1. **Leaderboard polish** ‚Äì filters, navigation back to recap, visual upgrades.
2. **Timing metrics** ‚Äì game duration + per-player turn timers (surface on dashboard + export).
3. **Responsive pass** ‚Äì tuned typography/margins for 1080p shared screens & tablets.
4. **Animations & FX** ‚Äì transition states, idle tips carousel, CRT effects.
5. **Data export** ‚Äì download JSON/CSV of game history for archival.
6. **Seed data** ‚Äì optional command to create demo game for screenshots/testing.
