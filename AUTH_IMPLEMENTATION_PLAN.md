# Authentication Implementation Plan

This PR provides the foundation for authentication but requires additional work to fully integrate.

## What's Included

1. **Database Migration** - Users table and relationships
2. **Auth Service** - JWT token generation and password hashing
3. **Auth Middleware** - JWT validation and route protection
4. **Auth Routes** - Login and registration endpoints
5. **Configuration** - Environment-based auth settings

## Still Needed (Future PRs)

### Backend
- [ ] Update all game routes to check user ownership
- [ ] Add user association when creating games
- [ ] Implement session management/logout
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Implement refresh tokens

### Frontend
- [ ] Login/registration UI components
- [ ] Token storage and management
- [ ] API client authentication headers
- [ ] Protected route navigation
- [ ] User session UI indicators

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Required for production
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
JWT_EXPIRY=7d
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=10
AUTH_ENABLED=true
```

## Migration Steps

1. Run database migration: `npm run backend:migrate`
2. Set JWT_SECRET in production environment
3. Deploy backend with auth middleware
4. Update frontend to handle authentication
5. Gradually migrate existing games to users

## Security Notes

- JWT secret MUST be changed from default in production
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds default)
- All routes except health/auth endpoints require authentication
- Token expiry set to 7 days by default

## Testing

The authentication can be disabled by setting `AUTH_ENABLED=false` for backward compatibility during migration.
